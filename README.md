# Capital Bikeshare Rebalancing  
  
This project focuses on solving public bikesharing platform issues with rebalancing. Specifically, I use data from Capital Bikeshare to model the number of bikes at any bike station in the future. The code, in Python, can be found in the 'wrangling' folder in a JuPyter Notebook, and the assocated paper can be found here on the main page in PDF form.
